# Flutter Starter Project Structure

This repository provides a structured template for organizing a Flutter project, designed to enhance scalability and maintainability. It establishes clear guidelines for organizing code, resources, and modules within the application.

### `lib/main.dart`

Entry point of the Flutter application.

### `lib/src/`

Main source folder containing the following subdirectories:

#### `data/`

Contains data-related logic such as repositories and data sources.

#### `extensions/`

Dart extension methods for various data types like `DateTime`, `int`, `String`, and `Time`.

#### `modules/`

Organized into feature modules, each with its own folder structure:

- **common/**: Shared components, models, state management, and views used across multiple modules.

- **module_name/**: An example structure for individual feature modules, each containing:
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
  - **models/**: Data models specific to the module.
  - **state_manager/**: State management logic.
  - **views/**: UI screens and widgets.

#### `resources/`

Non-code resources such as colors, dimensions, strings, and styles used throughout the application.

#### `services/`

Integrates external services, structured by type:

- **network/**: Includes networking-related configurations and utilities, such as `Dio` instance setup (`dio_instance.dart`).

- **storage/**: Manages local storage mechanisms, such as `SharedPreferences` handling (`shared_preference_storage.dart`).

## Usage

Describe how to use the project, including any prerequisites or dependencies.

## Getting Started

Provide steps for getting started with the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Customize the `lib/src/` directory according to your application's specific requirements.
3. Rename placeholder names like `module_name` with actual module names relevant to your project.
4. Expand upon the structure by adding more modules, components, and services as your project evolves.

## Next Steps

Suggestions for next steps in the project development:
- Customize Modules: Define specific modules tailored to your application's features.
- Enhance Services: Integrate additional services as needed for networking, storage, or other functionalities.
- Refine UI: Build out UI components and screens within each module, ensuring consistency and usability.
